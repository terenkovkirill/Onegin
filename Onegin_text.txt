My uncle used to be so sound, 
But after falling gravely ill 
Is craving homage, and has found
That could not make a better deal.
It is for others a good lesson,
But what a boredom is the session:
To watch a sick man day and night
And do not make a step aside!
What mean deceitfulness it is:
To feign compassion, dose the drugs,
To set and fluff the pillows, thus,
To entertain a half deceased,
To show fake sympathy, then, sigh
And think: Oh gosh, when will you die!

It was what a young rake expected,
When dusting post-chaise speeded him,
By Zeus’s supreme will elected
The only heir of all his kin.
The friends of “Ruslan and Lyudmila”!
Here is my novel in verse hero,
With no preface and just right now
Let me acquaint you with the one:
Eugene Onegin, my good fellow,
Was born on Neva’s even shores,
Which, probably, were home of yours,
Or where you used to shine and revel.
It’s where I also used to play,
But North is not for me, they say*.

His father served exactly fairly
Relying mostly on a debt,
At least three balls used to give yearly
And became bankrupt in the end.
Eugene’s fate, though, was well disposed:
At first, a Madame cared and nursed,
Then, paltry French cared for the kid.
The boy was frisky, but still sweet.
Monsieur l'Abbé was not too formal
Didn’t want to spoil the child’s rest,
Preferred to teach him just in jest
And didn't bore him with strict moral,
Reproved for pranks by gentle talk
To Summer Garden took for walk.
